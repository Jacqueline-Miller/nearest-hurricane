# nearest-hurricane

# Introduction
The aim of my program is to report which tropical cyclone storm system or hurricane had its center pass closest to a location specified by the user. I define tropical cyclones as being including all types of tropical cyclone storms such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes. Hurricanes are defined as hurricanes according to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale with category 1 hurricanes and higher being counted as hurricanes. The tropical cyclone must be a hurricane at its nearest point to the specified location for it to count as a hurricane if the user selects they would only like to return hurricane related data. 
I have limited my program to working only for locations within the North Atlantic Hurricane Basin. The North Atlantic Hurricane Basin is defined by the program as falling from 0 degrees N (Equator) in the south to 60 degrees N in the north and 98 degrees W (-98 degrees) in the West to 0 degrees longitude (the prime Meridian) in the East. 
# Getting The Code to Run Successfully
To successfully run the code I’ve written, you will need to have installed some libraries that do not come preloaded into the CS50 code environment. These include the tropical, shapely, and cartopy libraries. To be able to convert addresses entered by the user into longitude and latitude coordinates, you will also need to install the geopy library.
